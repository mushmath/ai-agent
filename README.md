An AI agent is a system or program that can perceive its environment, reason about what it perceives, and then take
actions to achieve specific goals — often autonomously.

Key Characteristics of an AI Agent:
----------------------------------
Autonomy:
It operates on its own without constant human intervention.

Perception:
It uses sensors (e.g., cameras, data input, APIs) to gather information about its environment. Reasoning and

Decision-Making:
It processes the input, evaluates options, and makes decisions.

Action:
It performs actions based on its decisions—this could be controlling a robot, sending a message, updating a database, etc.

Learning (optional but common):
Many AI agents can improve over time using machine learning techniques.

Examples:
--------
Virtual Assistant (like Siri or Alexa):
Perceives voice commands, interprets them, and responds or performs tasks.

Autonomous Vehicle AI:
Uses cameras and sensors to navigate roads, make driving decisions, and avoid obstacles.

Customer Support Chatbot:
Interacts with users via text, answers questions, and routes complex issues to humans.

Game AI Agent:
Controls non-player characters (NPCs), making decisions based on player actions and game state.


Types of AI Agents:
------------------
Simple Reflex Agent:
Responds directly to stimuli (e.g., a thermostat).

Model-Based Reflex Agent:
Maintains some internal state to handle more complex tasks.

Goal-Based Agent:
Takes actions to achieve specific goals.

Utility-Based Agent:
Chooses actions based on a measure of usefulness or happiness.

Learning Agent:
Improves performance over time based on past experiences.
